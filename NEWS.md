## openHAB branch name changes to install openHAB 4 ## August 12, 2023
The default openHABian branch name (this is something like the openHABian *version*)
changed from "openHAB3" to "openHAB".
The openHAB2 branch name changed from "stable" to "legacy".
You can use these names whenever you want to install a fresh openHABian system with
a specific openHAB version right in the first place using clonebranch=<branch name>
in openhabian.conf.

## IMPORTANT: installing openHAB 4 ## June 25, 2023
We will install openHAB 4 from now on. It will be the latest available milestone
release until general availability of the openHAB 4 release.

If you are on the default branch openHAB3 so far, please use menu option 01 to
change to openHAB branch when you upgrade/move to openHAB 4.
